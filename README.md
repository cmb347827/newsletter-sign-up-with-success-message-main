## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap custom overrides
- Bootstrap
- Sass/SCSS
- Javascript/Jquery
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I could have used Bootstrap to validate the form input , with the provided JS code at the link below. I went with my own code this time as this is a practice project.
- I also decided to disable the submit button until the email input is validated . Just to add to the learning curve.
  In my other projects I would add the email validation to the submit button on click. 

### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS. For now, in time I will go re-learn React ect.
